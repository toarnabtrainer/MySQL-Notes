* **Test different Joins:**
* **1. Equi Join**
* **2. Non-Equi Join**
* **3. Self Join**

* **5. Cross Join**
* **6. Outer Join**
   * **a. Left outer**
   * **b. Right outer**

-- Self join

-- Natural Join

-- cross join
SELECT *

-- outer join
-- left outer join

-- right outer join
SELECT *

-- Inner Join
SELECT *

-- Equi join with USING clause:
